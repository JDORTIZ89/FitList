# FitList

This app lets the user create their own workout playlists.

The target audience is for Physical Therapists and Personal Trainers to be able to send playlists tailored to their clients/patients.

Each exercise will have a visual representation(GIF) of the move to be performed, and which muscle(s) are the primary target. 

Eventually many features could be added:
- Equipment required filter
- user exercise upload feature (create GIF/description of move/stretch)
- stream the playlist to tv
- change workout from time based to qty based
-
